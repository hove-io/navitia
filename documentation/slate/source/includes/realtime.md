<h1 id="realtime">Real time integration in Navita</h1>

Several endpoints can integrate real time information in their responses. In the response received, disruptions can be present and additional information can be provided.
The parameter `data_freshness` can be set to
<ul>
    <li>`base_schedule`: disruptions may be present in the response for the user information, but it won't be taken into account in the results of the query.</li>
    <li>`realtime`: disruptions are taken into account to compute alternative journeys for exemple. In this configuration, every stop times, connexions, delays, or detour can be taken into account.</li>
</ul>

<aside class="notice">
`data_freshness=adapted_schedule` is deprecated and must not be providen. It can only be used for debbuging.
</aside>

<aside class="warning">
Real time isn't available on every coverage for Navitia. For real time to be available for a client, it needs to provide real time info about its network to Navitia.
</aside>

The effect of a disruption can be among the following:
<ul>
    <li>[SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS](#SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS)</li>
    <li>[REDUCED_SERVICE](#REDUCED_SERVICE)</li>
    <li>[NO_SERVICE](#NO_SERVICE)</li>
    <li>[MODIFIED_SERVICE](#MODIFIED_SERVICE)</li>
    <li>[ADDITIONAL_SERVICE](#ADDITIONAL_SERVICE)</li>
    <li>[UNKNOWN_EFFECT](#UNKNOWN_EFFECT)</li>
    <li>[DETOUR](#MODIFIED_SERVICE)</li>
    <li>[OTHER_EFFECT](#OTHER_EFFECT)</li>
</ul>

This list follows the GTFS RT values documented at <https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/#enum-effect>.

For each one of these effects, here's how the Navitia responses will be affected over the different endpoints.

<aside class="notice">
A disruption is present in the response of the endpoints described if the request is made during its application period.

<h2 id="PT_object_collections_data_freshness">Public transport object collections</h2>

Several public transport objects have separate collections for `base_schedule` and `realtime`.<br>So the data_freshness parameter may affect the number of objects returned depending on the request.

For example when looking for a specific circulation with the collection vehicle_journey using the request:<br>`https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/<toto>/vehicle_journeys?since=20191008T100000&until=20191008T200000&data_freshness=base_schedule`.

A vehicle_journey circulating between since and until that is **fully deleted** (NO_SERVICE) by a disruption will
of course be **visible** if `data_freshness=base_schedule`.<br>But it **will not appear** with the parameter `data_freshness=realtime` as it does not exist in that collection.

On the other hand, a vehicle_journey that is **created** by a realtime feed will only be **visible** if
`data_freshness=realtime` on that same request.<br>And it will **not appear** if `data_freshness=base_schedule`.

<h2 id="OTHER_EFFECT">Other effect</h2>

There is no known effect related to this disruption. You only have to show the message to your traveler...

<h2 id="SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS">Trip delayed</h2>

    "departure_status": "delayed",
    "stop_point": ⊕{7 items},
    "stop_time_effect": "delayed",
}
```

The effect of the disruption is `SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS`. It means that the train will arrive late at one or more stations in its journey.

In the disruption, the delay can be found in the list of "impacted_stops" with the departure/arrival status set to "delayed".

* "base_arrival_time"/"base_departure_time" represent the scheduled arrival/departure time without taking into account the delay
* whereas "amended_arrival_time"/"amended_departure_time" are the actual arrival/departure time, after the delay is applied

See the [disruption](#disruption) objects section for its full content and description.

The status of the journey is `SIGNIFICANT_DELAYS`.

In a public transport section of the response:

* "base_arrival_date_time"/"base_departure_date_time" represent the scheduled arrival/departure time without taking into account the delay
* whereas "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time" are the actual arrival/departure time, after the delay is applied

The delay can also be observed for every stop point of the journey with the same parameters in "stop_date_times".<br>If the parameter "data_freshness" is set to "base_schedule", then "base_arrival_date_time"/"base_departure_date_time" = "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time".

A list of the disruptions impacting the journey is also present at the root level of the response.<br>A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the section "display_informations".

    "departure_status": "deleted",
    "stop_point": ⊕{7 items},
    "stop_time_effect": "deleted",
}
```
The effect of the disruption is `REDUCED_SERVICE`. It means that the train won't be serving one or more stations in its journey.

In the disruption, the deleted stations can be found in the list of "impacted_stops" with the departure/arrival status set to "deleted".<br>See the [disruption](#disruption) objects section for its full content and description.

<div></div>

### Journeys

If the stop deleted is the origin/destination of a section of the journey, Navitia will compute a different itinerary to the requested station.<br>If not (deleting intermediate stop), the journey won't be affected.<br>Either way, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" like for other disruptions.

### Departures & Stop Schedules

At the deleted stop area, the departure time of the train with a reduced service simply won't be displayed in the list of departures/stop_schedules if "data_freshness" is set to "realtime".

If "data_freshness" is "base_schedule", then the depature time is displayed.<br>In that case, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" for departures, in the "date_times" object itself for stop_schedules.

    "severity": ⊖{
        "effect": "NO_SERVICE"
        "name": "trip canceled",
    },
}
```

The effect of the disruption is `NO_SERVICE`. It means that the train won't be circulating at all.

In the disruption, the deleted trip can be found in the "impacted_objects" list with the
"application_periods" describing the period(s) of unavailability for the trip.<br>See the [disruption](#disruption) objects section for its full content and description.

<div></div>

### Journeys

If the deleted trip is used by a section of the `base_schedule` journey, Navitia will compute a different
itinerary to the requested station in `realtime`, or a later one (without using that trip).<br>A link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" like for other disruptions, on a `base_schedule` journey.

### Departures & Stop Schedules

At the deleted stop area, the departure time of the cancelled train simply won't be displayed in the list of departures/stop_schedules if "data_freshness" is set to "realtime".

If "data_freshness" is "base_schedule", then the depature time is displayed.<br>In that case, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" for departures, in the "date_times" object itself for stop_schedules.

The status of the journey is `MODIFIED_SERVICE`. In a public transport section of the response, "arrival_date_time"/"departure_date_time" are the arrival/departure times of an added stop point. New stop points are only used when the "data_freshness" parameter is set to "realtime".

A list of the disruptions impacting the journey is also present at the root level of the response.<br>A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the section "display_informations".

<div></div>

### Departures & Stop Schedules

At the added stop area, the departure time of the train with a modified service is displayed if "data_freshness" is set to "realtime".<br>In that case, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" for departures, in the "date_times" object itself for stop_schedules.

The departure time of the train with a modified service simply won't be displayed in the list of departures/stop_schedules if "data_freshness" is set to "base_schedule".

The status of the journey is `MODIFIED_SERVICE`. This new journey can only be displayed if "data_freshness" is set to "realtime".<br>A list of disruptions impacting the journey is also present at the root level of the response.<br>A link to the concerned disruption can be found in the section "display_informations".

<div></div>

### Departures & Stop Schedules

At one of the added stop area from the additional trip, the departure time of the added train is displayed if "data_freshness" is set to "realtime".<br>In that case, a link to this disruption can be found in the section "display_informations" for departures, in the "date_times" object itself for stop_schedules.

The departure time of the train with an additional service simply won't be displayed in the list of departures/stop_schedules if "data_freshness" is set to "base_schedule".


<h2 id="UNKNOWN_EFFECT">Unknown effect aka "Back to normal"</h2>

``` shell
# Extract of an impacted stop from /disruptions
{
    "amended_arrival_time": "193200",
    "amended_departure_time": "193400",
    "arrival_status": "unchanged"

    "departure_status": "unchanged",
    "is_detour": false,
    "stop_point": ⊕{7 items},
    "stop_time_effect": "unchanged",
},
```
The effect of the disruption is `UNKNOWN_EFFECT`. It means that the disruption affecting the journey is no longer effective, and the trip is back to its theoritical schedule.<br>In the list of "impacted_stops" in the disruption, the "arrival_status"/"departure_status" is set to "unchanged".<br>See the [disruption](#disruption) objects section for its full content and description.
