Interface
=========

The base URL for **navitia.io** is:
<https://api.navitia.io/v1/>

We aim to implement [HATEOAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
concept with Navitia.

Every resource returns a response containing a links object, a paging
object, and the requested objects, following hypermedia principles.
That's lots of links. Links allow you to know all accessible uris and services for a given point.

<aside class="notice">
    Length (in characters) of the URL is limited to 4096 characters.

Templated URL
-------------

> From every object collection

``` shell
#first request

$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'

#response
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

#first line is like:

{
    "lines": [
        {
            "id": "line:RAT:M1",
            "code": "1",
            "name": "Château de Vincennes - La Défense",
            "...": "..."
        },
        {...}
        ],
    ...,

#and a templated link from the example above:

    "links": [
        {
            "href": "https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/{lines.id}/stop_schedules",
            "rel": "stop_schedules",
            "templated": true
        },
        {...}
    ]
}

#you can then request for "stop_schedules" service using templating
#be careful, without any filter, the response can be huge

#second request
#{line.id} has to be replaced by "line:RAT:M1"
$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/line:RAT:M1/stop_schedules' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'

#here is a smarter request for a line AND a stop_area
$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines/line:RAT:M1/stop_areas/stop_area:RAT:SA:PLROY/stop_schedules' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'
```

Under some link sections, you will find a "templated" property.

If "templated" is true, then you will have to format the link with your right id as describe in the example.
In order to do that, you will have to

* take the id from the object you want to get the linked service
* replace {lines.id} in the url as the example

Inner references
----------------
``` shell
#You may find "disruptions" link, as

{
    "internal": true,
    "type": "disruption",
    "id": "edc46f3a-ad3d-11e4-a5e1-005056a44da2",
    "rel": "disruptions",
    "templated": false
}
```

Some link sections holds disruption links. These links are templated.

That means:

* inside the self stream (**"internal": true**)
* you will find a **disruptions** section (**"rel": "disruptions"**)
* containing some [disruptions](#disruption) objects (**"type": "disruption"**)
* where you can find the details of your object (**"id": "edc46f3a-ad3d-11e4-a5e1-005056a44da2"**).

Paging
------

``` shell
#Retrieving lines collection
$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'

#You can find "paging" informations, as
{
    "pagination": {
        "items_on_page": 25
        "items_per_page": 25,
        "start_page": 1,
        "total_result": 1921,
    },
}

#You can also find "paging" links, prebuilt in the link section
{
       {
            "href": "https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/demo/lines?start_page=0",
            "templated": false
            "type": "previous",
        },
       {
            "href": "https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/demo/lines?start_page=2",
            "templated": false
            "type": "next",
        },
       {
            "href": "https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/demo/lines?start_page=76",
            "templated": false
            "type": "last",
        },
       {
            "href": "https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/demo/lines",
            "templated": false
            "type": "first",
        }
}
```


<aside class="success">
    The results are paginated to avoid too big response size. The parameters to get the next or previous page are within the `links` section of the result.
</aside>

Every Navitia response contains a paging object

|Key           |Type|Description                           |
|--------------|----|--------------------------------------|
|items_per_page|int |Number of items per page              |
|items_on_page |int |Number of items on this page          |
|start_page    |int |The page number                       |
|total_result  |int |Total number of items for this request|

You can navigate through a response using 2 parameters

|Parameter |Type|Description              |
|----------|----|-------------------------|
|start_page|int |The page number          |
|count     |int |Number of items per page |

<aside class="notice">
    The number of objects returned for a request can <b>not be superior than 200</b>.
    If you request for more, Navitia will return the first 200, and you will have to paginate to get next 200.
</aside>

Objects order
-------------

Unless specified, objects lists are not sorted and stability of objects' order is not guaranteed.<br>This is also true for the ordering of the attributes of objects.

Examples of sorted objects tables:

* journeys in a `/journeys` response
* `/departures` and `/arrivals`
* `/stop_schedules`
* `/terminus_schedules`
* stop_points in `/routes/{route_id}?depth=3`
* `/places_nearby`
* `/places`

Examples of unsorted responses:

* stop_points in `/lines/{line_id}/stop_points`
* pretty much everything else...

Objects attributes
------------------

Like almost any API, objects are subject to adaptations.<br>Please be warned that we allow Navitia to add new attributes to objects, and it will never be considered a breaking change.

We also allow Navitia to add values to enum, so be prepared to that. For example [section's](#section) type of journeys are regularly evolving.

Lifetime of id
--------------

The way id (or uri) of an object is generated is not garanteed stable, nor are the data processed.
So we advise to limit to the minimum storing ids/uris of objects.
We recommend to use as much as possible a previous call to **[Places](#places)** and **[PT_objects](#pt-objects)**.
Also, be resilient if one of those ids/uris disappears.
