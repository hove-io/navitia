<h1 id='getting-started'>Getting started</h1><h2 id='overview'>Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Navitia</strong> (<em>pronounce [navi-sia]</em>) is the open API for building cool stuff with mobility data.</p>

<p>It provides the following services:</p>

<ul>
<li>multi-modal journeys computation</li>
<li>line schedules</li>
<li>next departures</li>
<li>exploration of public transport data</li>
<li>search &amp; autocomplete on places</li>
<li>and sexy things such as isochrones</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="#some-examples">examples below</a> to learn what services we provide and how to use them.</p>
<h3 id='approach'> Approach</h3>
<p>Navitia is an open-source web API, <strong>initially</strong> built to provide traveler information on urban transportation networks.<br>Its main purpose is to provide day-to-day informations to travelers.<br>Over time, Navitia has been able to do way more, <em>sometimes</em> for technical and debuging purpose <em>or</em> because other functional needs fit quite well in what Navitia can do <em>or</em> just because it was quite easy and super cool.</p>

<p>Technically, Navitia is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> API that returns JSON formated results.</p>
<h3 id='who-39-s-who'> Who&#39;s who</h3>
<p>Navitia is instanciated and exposed publicly through <a href="https://api.navitia.io">api.navitia.io</a>.<br>Developments on Navitia are lead by Hove (previously Kisio Digital and CanalTP).<br>Hove is a subsidiary of Keolis (itself a subsidiary of SNCF, French national railway company).</p>
<h3 id='about-quot-sandbox-quot-coverage'>About &quot;sandbox&quot; coverage</h3>
<aside class="notice">
Every example is based on fake data. Sandbox data is made up of few fake metro lines from a single network on the area of Paris only. If you want to play with real data, use your token and explore the world!
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
A fake token is used in examples below: be aware that this token is really limited ("sandbox" coverage only).</br>
You have to use yours to get real services on real data (your token has no access to "sandbox" coverage).
</aside>
<h2 id='first-step'>First step</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Your token is available on your <a href="https://navitia.io/se-connecter/">navitia.io account page</a>.</p>

<p>It sounds like &quot;3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get a token here <a href="https://navitia.io/inscription/">https://navitia.io/inscription/</a>. We need your mail to stay in touch when Navitia changes.</p>

<aside class="notice">
The token obtained is private, you should avoid sharing it publicly (beware if you share code examples, url or screenshot).</br>
This will avoid having someone use your request quota.
</aside>
<h2 id='second-step'>Second step</h2><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell tab-shell"><code><span class="c"># You can use curl to request Navitia</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="s1">'https://api.navitia.io/v1/'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Go to the API <a href="https://api.navitia.io">https://api.navitia.io</a></p>

<p>The simpliest way is to use a web browser.
Our humble opinion is that <a href="https://www.getfirefox.com">firefox browser</a> and a json viewer extension like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/json-lite/">JSON Lite</a> is a good setup.</p>
<h2 id='third-step'>Third step</h2><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell tab-shell"><code><span class="c"># In a curl way, with our fake token</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>curl <span class="s1">'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/'</span> <span class="nt">-H</span> <span class="s1">'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Use the token: if you use a modern web browser, you only have to <strong>paste it</strong> in the <strong>user name area</strong>,
with <strong>no password</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/firefox_token-aa369f75.png" alt="Put token in Firefox browser" /></p>

<p>Or, in a simplier way, you can add your token in the address bar like:</p>

<aside class="success">
<a href="https://3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0@api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines">https://3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0@api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/lines</a>
</aside>

<p>See <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> section to find out more details on <strong>how to use your token</strong> when coding.</p>
<h4 id='then'>Then,</h4>
<p>use the API! The easiest is probably to jump to <a href="#some-examples">Examples</a> below.</p>

<p>At some point you will want to read <a href="#lexicon">transport public lexicon</a>.</p>

<h2 id="about-data">About the data</h2>

<p>The street network is extracted from <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. The public transport data are provided by networks that provide their timetables as open data. Some data improvements are achieved by Hove and are published back there <a href="https://navitia.opendatasoft.com">https://navitia.opendatasoft.com</a>.</p>

<p>Want to know if your city is in Navitia? Know if a special contributor is used? You can either search in <a href="#datasets">datasets</a> of the different <a href="#coverage">coverages</a>. Or use the filter provided on our data catalog <a href="https://navitia.opendatasoft.com">https://navitia.opendatasoft.com</a>.</p>

<aside class="success">
    We are gradually supporting more and more cities. If your city has open public transport data and is missing,
    check our googlegroup and drop us a note at <a href="mailto:navitia@googlegroups.com">navitia@googlegroups.com</a>.
    </br>
    We will try to add it to navitia.io
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
    Please note that the creation of a new coverage on our servers requires resources,
    so on some data integrations we try to make sure that the amount of requests justifies the use of those resources.
    </br>
    Your feedback and requests are very welcome so we choose the most useful new coverages depending on available resources.
