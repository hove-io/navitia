This file encapsulates the implementation of future, one can easily change the implementation of future (ex.
use concurrent.futures ) by
1. creating a new future class of future and implementing methods 'get_future' and 'wait_and_get'
2. creating a new PoolManager and implementing __enter__ and __exit__ which allows all created future to be run
   (the way to do cleaning depends on the library of future to use)
