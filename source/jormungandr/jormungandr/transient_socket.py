    With this class, sockets will be shut down and reopened if the TTL run out.
    This is useful especially for services that are hosted on AWS and accesses by Zmq.

    Why?

    Because jormungandr creates sockets via the AWS's autobalancer, when a new instance is popped by auto scaling,
    despite the auto balancer, sockets created previously will still stick to the old instance. We have to close the
    socket and reopen one so that traffic will be lead to new instances.
