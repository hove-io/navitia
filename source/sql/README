Initialization
--------------

You need a postgres/postgis database.
You have to change the variable sqlalchemy.url in alembic.ini
If your database is new, you have to run:
    PYTHONPATH=. alembic upgrade head
Otherwise, you need to initialize once alembic on your database with:
    PYTHONPATH=. alembic stamp head

Change the model
--------------

You have to make a revision with:
    PYTHONPATH=. alembic revision -m "My message"
and change the produced file in alembic/versions, and add it to git
